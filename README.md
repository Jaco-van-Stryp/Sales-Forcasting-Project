# Project Description: 

Start up businesses that sell digital and physical products often go in blind sighted not knowing if their product will do well or not. We are encouraged to create a system where the user can simply search for a product or service, and get real time predictions using a dynamic website on how their product has performed and will perform in the future. Our algorithm will be optimised to be of professional standards and regular quality control will be done to ensure we deliver the best product we possibly can.


We will run a Dynamic Website with a backend server providing the real time updates, we will be using varouse API services to ensure accurate information. We will be working in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, mySQL, C# and Java to deliver accurate results and provide server side information to the user. Our website will be created in a way where there are many additional features such as subscription based services and account based information to ensure all people have personalised and useful results, our features will ensure a stable income to afford our backend services as well as make sure our developers are compensated for the work they deliver on providing regular updates.

Sales Forecasting will be run under the company name Jaxify-Software which is setup in a way where it can run many different services along Sales Forecasting. We are encouraged to provide a highly professional and functional product capable of providing a stable income.

# Project Scope

In this project, we are determined to develop a complete and fully functional & professional website that will have the functionality of predicting future sale information such as “Hand Sanitiser”, “Soap”, “Petrol” etc, we want to use an API system along with client and web side systems to achieve this.

For our Project Scope, we’ve Assigned a research assignment to every student to get some background information on what the project is about, what is expected of them and how all the systems will work. We will operate on regular Online & In person meetings to discuss an essential work schedule that will guide us through this entire project to ensure we deliver professional and quality work.


Excluding holidays, we have pre-planned an entire work schedule that spans through the entire year up until september where we plan on finishing with our project. In this work schedule, we planned everything in a way where we are always ahead of the official schedule by giving everyone work on a weekly basis, all work will be quality checked and tested to ensure quality. Our work schedule starts with a research stage that follows up on a planning stage where pseudocode and layouts will be created to ensure everyone is on the same page. We will be coding our website using HTML, CSS and Javascript while using various other backend languages and systems such as Microsoft Azure.

Everyone will have their roles switched around at a regular pase to give everyone proper exposure to all the work, each student will be required to submit the work that was expected of them in a Folder that they can access while the project leader will grade them of this work in a dedicated logbook that allows our supervisors to monitor us as well as ensure everyone is on track. At Least one student will do a quality check on the work that was expected of others every week to make sure everything is produced of highest quality, if the quality tester is not happy or negative feedback is given, it is the responsibility of the student in charge to keep working until the tester is happy. The project leader will ensure to create issue reports should this happen and extend the due date for that specific student

Once we coded the website and added basic functionality, we will be making use of API’s that will do our searching for us, we will be using online database software to store and manage the data, while all the appropriate data will be seamlessly presented to the user once they preview it.

After adding the functionality that makes our project work. We will add subscription services that allow users to gain more features and gain access to unlimited searches. 

After everything is finished, each and every student will do an in depth analysis on all the features and the entirety of the website, this will also be the drop dead date where we disallow any additional features to be added. Any work that still needs to be done will be dedicated to the time left before submission of our project is due.
